## 🚨 Problem

Dengue fever kills thousands annually, and 70% of mosquito breeding happens in urban areas that go unreported. Traditional tracking systems are slow, unreliable, and lack community engagement. We need a faster, smarter way to identify and eliminate breeding sites before outbreaks occur.
